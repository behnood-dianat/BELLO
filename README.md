# BELLO
BELLO code is a post-processing script-tool created for the automatic analysis and extraction of structural characteristics of disordered and amorphous systems. BELLO is agnostic to the code that generated single configurations or trajectories. Its capabilities include calculation of order parameter q, folded structure identification, statistics, detailed atomic coordination number and pair/angle-distribution functions.
